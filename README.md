## About Me 🙋🏾‍♂️

Hello, my name is James Chirambo.  I have previously worked with clinical data and I am currently aspiring to be a data scientist. I am passionate about working with data and gaining insights from the data.

I started working as a data officer, moving up to data manager, where I was introduced to data analysis. Gaining insights from data interests me the most.
This passion led me to study more about data science, technology and innovations.
