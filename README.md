## About Me üôãüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Hello, my name is James Chirambo.  
With over 6 years of dedicated experience in data management within the health research sector, my core competencies lie in developing robust data systems and leading IT initiatives that support critical research activities, such as those demonstrated in the [CAPS study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)32507-7/fulltext).
I started working as a data officer, moving up to data manager, where I was introduced to data analysis. I am passionate about working with data and gaining insights from the data.

After taking a fulfilling 8 years career break to focus on full-time parenting, while studying on part-time basis, I am excited to re-enter the workforce with renewed energy and enhanced skills. 
During this break, I have attained a BSc (Hons) in Business Information Technology and a MSc in Data Science, Technology and Innovation.
My Master's studies at The University of Edinburgh has enriched my expertise in Data Science.
